# Satisfactory
Find the optimal recipe rates (for the game Satisfactory) to maximize production of one or multiple desired outputs.  Since there are multiple recipe routes, the optimizer must find which routes to take.  The goal is to produce a model which predicts recipe rates for a variable amount of input resources.
